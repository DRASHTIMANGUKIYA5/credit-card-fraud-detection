# credit-card-fraud-detection
Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using time series analysis and machine learning techniques. The model leverages trend analysis, seasonal decomposition, and spectral analysis to identify patterns and anomalies, optimizing detection accuracy using Random Forest.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and transforms time-based data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes visualization of transaction trends, seasonal decomposition, and correlation analysis.
Time Series Analysis:
Autocorrelation Function (ACF) & Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots. Seasonal decomposition to detect trends and anomalies.Spectral analysis for frequency-based insights.

Fraud Detection Model:
Uses Random Forest Classifier for classification.
Features include transaction amount, time-based attributes, and more.
Evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
